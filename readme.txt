Known Issues:
-Sprite movement not well-synced with camera. I can make it so either the player character jitters for the first frame of movement, or every other object is slightly behind.
-Saving and Loading the game will pretty much break everything, especially schedules.
-Loading maps only sometimes does what I want it to do.
-The coroner is invisible. (Drawing people is hard ;-;)
-Combat maps will sometimes hold over data from old battles.
-Going to or below 0 HP in a fight won't kill you yet.
-Sprites render on top of health bars of units beneath them.
-Multi-tile sprites aren't always in-sync
-Sprites with randomized skin tones (like Rencid and Eieun) will have their skin tones re-randomized upon entering battle.
-The magic tutorial doesn't actually bother to check what your spell is.
